 <br> $11 + 25$ and $8 * 8$, do they represent two sides of an equation ?",False,,,,True,,,60,3,,2018.rohan.pol@ves.ac.in,"<br>
            
To check equality of expressions we will check if both of them give same result or not
 <br>First expression $11 + 25 = 36$
 <br>Second expression $8 * 8 = 64$
<br>Since both expressions give different values, the answer is False",
